# Chattr
A basic chat app

## Application Structure
The intent of this project is to creat a very basic chat app. This app leverages Vuejs, and NodeJS using Express and WebSockets.

VueJS was chosen due to my familiarity with the library and vue-cli should give us the tooling we need to standup the front-end of this app quickly

NodeJS was chosen as our server because Express servers are quick to standup and this is not a computationally heavy task with a limited amount of concurrent users.

Websockets were added for near-real time communication between the server and clients. 

## How to install

`npm i && npm run serve`
